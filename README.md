# Emotion Detection <a name="about-project"></a>
This project is used for the detection of emotion in text.  Emotions that can be detected are: Happy, Fear, Sad, Surprise, Hate, Angry, and Natural. The specific use case of this project is the detection of students' emotions in text, but can be used for other purposes.
## Built With <a name="built-with"></a>

### Tech Stack <a name="tech-stack"></a>

For this project, we use pandas for data analysis and data cleaning. also, we use Hazm for data cleaning. For the detection model, we use a neural network with TensorFlow and machine learning models with scikit-learn packages.

### Key Features <a name="key-features"></a>

- **[Persian Emotion Detection]**
- **[Easy usage]**
- **[different models]**

## Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>


### Prerequisites

In order to run this project you need:

```sh
 !pip install tensorflow
 !pip install pandas
 !pip install dadmatools
 !pip install fasttext
 !pip install numpy
 !pip install sklearn
```

### Setup

Clone this repository to your desired folder:

```sh
  cd my-folder
  git clone git@github.com:Emad78/Emotion-detection.git
```


### Usage
Trained models have been placed in the models directory and can be used for classification. the input of models is the vector of text feature. process of generating an input vector has been shown in the model.py file. the output of models is emotion detected in text.
